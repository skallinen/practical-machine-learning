###Summary
The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which the subjects in the tests did their exercise. The result is represented by "classe" variable in the training set. We ended up using 53 variables of 159 in all to predict the categories and got extremely accurate results using the random forests algorithm. The sample error rate was less than a half a per cent (0.43%).  The model predicted all the 20 test problems correctly.  

**Background**  
Quoted from the assignment page: Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: [http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har] (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

                download.file(paste(url, file, sep = ""), 
                              file, 
                              method = "curl")
        }
}
#downloadFiles(dataURL, trainingFile)
#downloadFiles(dataURL, testingFile)

```

The data is downloaded in home folder. Next we will load it into R. It is important to tell R which values should be interpreted as NAs, hence the `na.strings = c("NA", "#DIV/0!","")` -argument. 

```{r}
#===============================================================================
# Reads the files
#===============================================================================

## load the df
testing <- read.csv(testingFile, na.strings = c("NA", "#DIV/0!",""))
training <- read.csv(trainingFile, na.strings = c("NA", "#DIV/0!",""))

```

Next we'll first set the seed, accorging to the assignment and then clean the data. Quick exploration shows that the first columns "X" to "num_window" are metadata that are not sensor outputs. According to the accompanied reserach paper, the researcers used time windows as way of splitting the data. My first strategy is to remove those i.e. all time window, timestamp and data about persons and to first only focus on the actual sensor data. So columns "X" to "num_window" are removed from the dataset. After having done that i do some explored the number of NAs in the different columns using the `apply(training, 2, function(x) sum(is.na(x) )` command. It reveals that most of the columns that have NAs consist almost entirely of NAs. So we'll remove those columns, that is all that have any NAs, as well. Now we have reduced the number of variables from 160 to 53.

```{r}

#===============================================================================
# Setting the seed, cleaning the data and selecting variables and features
#===============================================================================

set.seed(3433)
makeTidy <- function(dat){
        dat <- select(dat, -X:-num_window)
        dat <- dat[,apply(dat, 2, function(x) !any(is.na(x)))]
        if("classe" %in% names(dat)) {
                apply(select(dat, -classe), 2, as.numeric)
                dat$classe <- as.factor(dat$classe)      
        } else {
                apply(dat, 2, as.numeric)  
        }
        dat
}
training <- makeTidy(training)
```

Now we split the training data into two, for cross validation. We'll create a training set (subtraining) that includes 60 % of the entire training data and 30% for cross validation.

```{r}
#===============================================================================
# Setting the seed and creating test & training sets for cross validation
#===============================================================================


set.seed(3433)
inTrain = createDataPartition(training$classe, p = .60)[[1]]
subtraining = training[ inTrain,]
subtesting = training[-inTrain,]

```

We'll now do some feature exploration. We actually started with doing principal component analysis, but the prediction results were actually worse than without any preprocessing. But when we did the preprocessing with default values we got some improvement in accuracy, albeit miniscule. This will be shown in a moment. The improvement was so slight because accuracy without any preprocessing was extremely high. We would probably have skipped the preprocessing altoghether, had we known it from the beginning.

**Building the model and doing cross validation**
The model was built using the random forest algorithm that has been successful when predicting as here predicting categorical outcomes. We first tried the random forest method using the *train* function in the caret package, but that was tediously slow, and after researching the course forums got tipped that creating the model using the function directly from the randomForset package is much faster. And indeed it was. It did the calculations in matter of a minute or two. Testing the model on the traing data now.

```{r}

preProc <- preProcess(select(subtraining,-classe))
trainPC <- predict(preProc,select(subtraining, -classe))
trainPC$classe <- subtraining$classe
modelFit1 <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data = trainPC)
confusionMatrix(subtraining$classe,predict(modelFit1,trainPC))
```

The model predicts with accuracy of 100% on the training data. There is a risk that the model has been overfitted. We'll find out by running the model on the test data. If it performs significantly worse, then we might have been overfitting.

```{r}

testPC <- predict(preProc,select(subtesting, -classe))
testPC$classe <- subtesting$classe
confusionMatrix(subtesting$classe,predict(modelFit1,testPC))
```


Wow, the model performs very well on the the training set and doing cross validation results in perdiction accuracy of whopping 0.993, that is 0.7% sample error rate. These are very good results, that does not differ more than expected from the results on the training data. We can conclude that the model has not been overfitted.

Just to test, we also created a model without preprocessing the data:


```{r}
modelFit2 <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data = subtraining)
confusionMatrix(subtesting$classe,predict(modelFit2,subtesting))
```

Without preprocessing we got prediction accuracy of 0.9927 in cross validation test. As mentioned above, in this case we would not have really needed to do the preprocessing.

The accuracy is very high, so we decided not to explore any further but to use this algorithm.

**Final thoughts**  
If these results are correct, as they seem, it does raise the question how come it predicts so well and why the results that the reserachers got were so much worse. It seems almost unbelieveble to get results that are this good. One also wonders why the researchers did not try this approach as it was done almost entirely using defaults.

**Submitting the test problems**  
The following code creates the text files with predictions needed to submit the test problems. These predictions use the same model as above.

```{r eval=FALSE}

pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}
testing <- makeTidy(testing)
pml_write_files(predict(modelFit2, testing))
```
